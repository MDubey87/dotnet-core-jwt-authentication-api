# JWT Authentication Implementation in .Net Core Api
This is a demo .Net core Api application in which JWT Authentication is implemented

# Structure
This Solution has three projects-
- JWTAuthentication.WebApi - This will be Api in which we will have two endpoints, one to Authenticate the user and return JWT Token. Another endpoint will be secure which will return data only for valid tokens.
- JwtAuthentication.Services - This will act as a service layer.
- JWTAuthentication.TokenManager - This is a class library where we have implemented JWT token generation.
